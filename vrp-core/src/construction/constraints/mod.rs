//! Various built-in constraints applied to customers and vehicles/drivers.
//!
//!
//! ## Constraint
//!
//! Constraint represents some limitation which should be applied to solution. A good examples:
//!
//! - **time**: customer can be visited only in specific time window, e.g. from 9am till 11am
//! - **capacity**: there is a fleet and multiple customers with total demand exceeding capacity
//!   of one vehicle from the fleet.
//! - **shift-time**: vehicle or driver cannot operate more than specific amount of time.
//!
//! Typically, VRP can have many of such constraints applied to its solution.
//!
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! There are multiple types of constraints described below in details. In common, all of them try
//! to identify insertion possibility or cost of given customer known as `Job` into given route.
//!
//!
//! ### Constraint characteristics
//! Each constraint has two characteristic:
//!
//! - **hard or soft**: this characteristic defines what should happen when constraint is violated.
//!     When hard constraint is violated, it means that given customer cannot be served with given
//!     route. In contrast to this, soft constraint allows insertion but applies some penalty to
//!     make violation less attractive.
//!
//! - **route or activity**: this characteristic defines on which level constrain is executed.
//!     As a heuristic algorithm is based on insertion heuristic, insertion of one customer is
//!     evaluated on each leg of one route. When it does not make sense, the route constraint
//!     can be used as it is called only once to check whether customer can be inserted in given
//!     route.
//!
//!
//! ### Constraint module
//!
//! Sometimes you might need multiple constraints with different characteristics to implement some
//! aspect of VRP variation. This is where `ConstraintModule` supposed to be used: it allows you
//! to group multiple constraints together keeping implementation details hidden outside of module.
//! Additionally, `ConstraintModule` provides the way to share some state between insertions.
//! This is really important as allows you to avoid unneeded computations.
//!
//!
//! ### Sharing state
//!
//! You can share some state using `RouteState` object which is part of `RouteContext`. It is
//! read-only during insertion evaluation in all constraint types, but it is mutable via `ConstraintModule`
//! methods once best insertion is identified.
//!
//!
//! ### Constraint pipeline
//!
//! All constraint modules are organized inside one `ConstraintPipeline` which specifies the order
//! of their execution.
